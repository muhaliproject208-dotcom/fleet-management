## Risk Management

### Understanding the Risk System

The risk assessment system helps identify potential safety issues before accidents occur. It uses a point-based system that tracks driver behavior and compliance.

### How Risk Points Are Assigned

#### Critical Violations (3-5 points)

**5 Points:**
- Accidents or collisions (even minor)
- Extreme speeding in hazardous zones
- DUI or substance-related violations
- Refusing safety protocols

**4 Points:**

- Multiple traffic infractions in one trip
- Driving with critical vehicle faults

**3 Points:**
- Excessive continuous driving (over 4 hours)
- Traffic infractions from police/RTSA
- Serious speed violations
- Ignoring mandatory rest stops

#### Moderate Violations (2 points)

- Speeding in school zones (over 40 km/hr)
- Speeding in market areas (over 40 km/hr)
- Not taking scheduled breaks (every 2 hours)
- Minor accident without injuries
- Improper rest stop usage

#### Minor Violations (1 point)

- Slight speed infractions
- Late reporting
- Minor documentation issues
- Small compliance oversights

### Risk Levels Explained

#### Low Risk (0-3 points in 30 days)
**What It Means:**
- Driver has excellent safety record
- No significant violations
- Consistently follows procedures

**Action Required:**
- Continue normal operations
- Regular monitoring
- Positive recognition

**Example:**
Driver completes 15 trips in 30 days with zero violations. They consistently follow speed limits, take required breaks, and maintain excellent safety practices.

#### Medium Risk (4-9 points in 30 days)
**What It Means:**
- Some safety concerns identified
- Pattern of minor violations developing
- Needs attention and coaching

**Action Required:**

- Coaching session with supervisor
- Review of safety procedures
- Additional training if needed

**Example:**
Driver has been speeding in school zones twice (4 points) and missed one required rest break (2 points) over 30 days. Total: 6 points (Medium Risk). Driver needs coaching on speed awareness and fatigue management.

#### High Risk (10+ points in 30 days)
**What It Means:**
- Serious safety concerns present
- Multiple violations occurring
- Potential danger to self and others
- Immediate action required

**Action Required:**

- Possible suspension from driving
- Mandatory retraining program
- Performance improvement plan
- Close monitoring upon return

**Example:**
Driver has had one minor accident (5 points), multiple speeding violations (4 points), and drove 5 hours without break (3 points) in past 30 days. Total: 12 points (High Risk). Driver suspended pending safety retraining.

### Risk Score Calculation

#### This Trip Score
- Only counts violations from current trip
- Immediate assessment of trip safety
- Ranges from 0 points (perfect) to 20+ points (multiple serious violations)

**Example:**
Driver completes trip with one school zone speeding incident (2 points). This trip score: 2 points (Low Risk).

#### 30-Day Rolling Score
- Adds all violation points from last 30 days
- Shows trends over time
- Older violations "expire" after 30 days

**Example Timeline:**
- Day 1: Trip with 2 points → 30-day total: 2 points
- Day 10: Trip with 3 points → 30-day total: 5 points (Medium Risk)
- Day 20: Trip with 1 point → 30-day total: 6 points (Medium Risk)
- Day 31: Day 1 trip drops off → 30-day total: 4 points (Medium Risk)

### Behavior Monitoring Details

The system tracks specific behaviors during each trip:

#### Speed Compliance
- **School Zones**: Must be ≤40 km/hr
- **Market Areas**: Must be ≤40 km/hr

A: No. The system works in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). You just need an internet connection.

**Q: Can I access the system on my phone?**
A: Yes. The system is mobile-friendly and can be used on smartphones and tablets.

**Q: What if I forget my password?**
A: Click "Forgot Password" on the login page. You'll receive a reset link via email.

**Q: How long does an inspection take?**
A: Pre-trip inspection: 15-20 minutes. Post-trip reporting: 10-15 minutes.

**Q: Can I save a partial inspection and come back later?**
A: Not currently. Complete the inspection in one session to ensure data accuracy.

### For Drivers

**Q: What if I find a problem during pre-trip inspection?**
A: Report it immediately in the system. Your supervisor will review and decide if the vehicle needs attention before the trip.

**Q: Can I see my own performance history?**
A: Yes. You can view all your past inspections and performance evaluations in your driver profile.

**Q: What happens if I get a "High Risk" rating?**
A: Your supervisor will meet with you to discuss concerns. You may receive additional training and closer monitoring.

**Q: What if I disagree with my evaluation score?**
A: Speak with your supervisor. They can review the evaluation and explain the reasoning. If needed, management can review disputed evaluations.

**Q: Do I have to report minor scratches or damage?**
A: Yes. Report all damage, even minor. This protects you from being blamed for pre-existing damage.

### For Supervisors

**Q: How quickly do I need to approve inspections?**
A: Ideally within 30 minutes of submission to avoid delaying trips. Critical trips should be prioritized.

**Q: What if a driver consistently scores low?**
A: Document the pattern, provide coaching, consider additional training, and involve management if performance doesn't improve.

**Q: Can I edit an inspection after it's approved?**
A: No. Once approved, inspections are locked. Contact IT if corrections are absolutely necessary.

**Q: How do I handle emergency situations?**
A: Use the system for documentation, but don't let it delay emergency response. Handle the emergency first, document after.

**Q: What if GPS data conflicts with driver's report?**
A: Address the discrepancy with the driver. GPS data is generally accurate, but technical issues can occur. Investigate thoroughly.

### For Mechanics

**Q: Do I inspect every vehicle every day?**
A: Only vehicles flagged with issues or those due for scheduled maintenance. Routine pre-trip inspections are handled by drivers.

**Q: What if repairs will take longer than expected?**
A: Update the system immediately. This allows management to arrange alternative vehicles for scheduled trips.

**Q: Can I see a vehicle's maintenance history?**
A: Yes. The system tracks all inspections and repairs for each vehicle.

### About Risk Assessment

**Q: How long do violation points stay on record?**
A: Points affect the 30-day rolling score, but complete history is maintained permanently for record-keeping.

**Q: Can points be removed or reduced?**
A: No. However, good performance over time naturally reduces the 30-day score as old violations expire.

**Q: What's the difference between risk score and performance evaluation?**
A: Risk score focuses on specific violations and safety issues. Performance evaluation is broader and includes work quality and professionalism.

**Q: Is the risk system punitive?**
A: No. It's designed to identify training needs and prevent accidents, not to punish drivers. It's a safety tool.

### About Reports

**Q: How long are reports kept?**
A: Indefinitely. All inspection records are retained for regulatory compliance and historical reference.

**Q: Can I export data for my own analysis?**
A: Contact your administrator. They can export data in various formats for analysis.

**Q: Who can see my reports?**
A: Drivers see their own reports. Supervisors see all reports in their area. Administrators have full access. Reports are confidential.

**Q: Can I print reports?**
A: Yes. Use the "Download PDF" button on any inspection report. The PDF is printer-friendly.

### Technical Issues

**Q: What if the system is slow or not responding?**
A: Check your internet connection. Try refreshing the page. If problems persist, contact IT support.

**Q: What if I lose internet connection during an inspection?**
A: Unfortunately, current data may be lost. Complete inspections when you have stable internet. Mobile data works fine.

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
A: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (all current versions). Internet Explorer is not supported.
